Pizza dough:

1. All-purpose flour , best option would be Tipo 00 flour - this is what Neapolitan restaurants use -
2. Yeast
3. Olive oil
4. Kosher salt (not table salt!)
5. Semolina flour or cornmeal , you use this to dust the pizza stone before baking

Hand knead the dough, or use a stand mixer. You can use your hands for this easy thin crust pizza dough recipe! You don’t need any special equipment at all. A KitchenAid or stand mixer works well too and makes it totally hands off. The kneading time in both cases is 8 minutes.
It takes 45 minutes to rise before baking! While it’s easy, thin crust pizza dough is not necessarily quick. Most of the time required for making the dough is letting it rise. Start making your pizza dough about 1 hour before you’d like to eat your pizza to account for the rise time.
For best results, cook on a pizza stone and pizza peel. The two pizza making tools you need: a pizza stone to cook the dough at very high heat, and a pizza peel to remove the dough from the stone.
